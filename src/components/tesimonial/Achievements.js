        Raghupathi is very responsive and adaptable when it comes to communication. He makes sure to respond quickly and follow up as appropriate. He is friendly, energetic, and passionate about his work.
        Raghupathi also has an amazing ability to put together quality code. His coding is clean, easy to read, and implements creative ways to solve problems. He maintains good coding habits including continuously saving to source control as well as refactoring as needed. He is very adaptable to new technologies and implementing them as needed in timely manner. His work in generating the QA metric custom dashboards in Azure dashboards was highly appreciated.
